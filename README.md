# evaluation-metrics

The evaluation steps can be broken into similarity, utility, validation, and privacy measures. 
1.	Similarity metrics are anything that helps us to identify how statistically similar the synthetic data is to the original data. 
1.	Utility metrics identifies how useful the synthetic data is with prediction and modelling tasks.
1.	Validation metrics seeks to confirm certain theoretical truths that should hold true for the synthetic dataset. 
1.	Privacy metrics seeks to measure how well sensitive attributes and membership presence are hidden.
