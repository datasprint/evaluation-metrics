# evaluation-metrics

The evaluation steps can be broken into similarity, utility, validation, and privacy measures. 
•	Similarity metrics are anything that helps us to identify how statistically similar the synthetic data is to the original data. 
•	Utility metrics identifies how useful the synthetic data is with prediction and modelling tasks.
•	Validation metrics seeks to confirm certain theoretical truths that should hold true for the synthetic dataset. 
•	Privacy metrics seeks to measure how well sensitive attributes and membership presence are hidden.
